# MiniMax Scoring System:
based on the following assumption:
a player, in is turn, would aspire to: Win (sequence of 4), place in the center column, sequence of 3 and then of 2 - in that order.
Each goal will have a corresponding score:
- WIN - 10000 Ps
- Center Piece - 3 Ps Each
- 3 Seq - 5 Ps Each
- 2 Seq - 2 Ps Each
- Scoring the Opponent will be the same with negative values
*Sequences are looked at by windows of 4: i.g. counted with gaps ,i.e. *00* / **00 --> 2 seq
